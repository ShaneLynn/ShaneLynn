- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShaneLynn
- 👀 I’m interested in software development of all kinds either web or traditional.  I am currently employed as a developer working with Java to build web apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Java ecosystem and I am in a web dev boot camp learning the C# infrastructure and Azure.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone interested in building stuff.
- 📫 How to reach me best is through email.
- (I think this new github feature is neat too)
